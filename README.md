A repository to explore [Github templates](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests) for issues and PRs.

## Issue templates

It is possible to have [multiple issue templates](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository), to [configure an issue template chooser](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#configuring-the-template-chooser) and to add other support links.

## PR templates

It is also possible to have [multiple PR templates](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository) by placing them under the [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/) directory. However, they will only be used if the template is [selected via query parameters](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-automation-for-issues-and-pull-requests-with-query-parameters) when opening the PR. [Click here](https://github.com/gustavocovas/github-templates/compare/feature/change-greeting?expand=1&template=enhancement.md) for such an example.

The default PR template is set using the [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](.github/pull_request_template.md) file.
